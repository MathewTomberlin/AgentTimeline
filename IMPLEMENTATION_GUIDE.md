### Functional Features and Limitations

AgentTimeline is a production-ready AI conversation management system with the following core capabilities and current limitations:

#### Core Functionality
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Integrates with Ollama (sam860/dolphin3-qwen2.5:3b) for context-aware chat.
- **Context-Augmented Generation**: Uses vector similarity search to retrieve relevant conversation history and expands context with surrounding message chunks.
- **Automatic Embedding & Chunking**: Each message is automatically split into overlapping chunks and embedded (768-dim, nomic-embed-text).
- **Session Management**: Supports isolated conversations via unique session IDs.
- **Message Chaining**: Maintains parent-child relationships for reconstructing conversation flow.
- **Chain Validation & Repair**: Detects and repairs broken message chains automatically.
- **Multi-turn Context**: Assistant can recall user information across multiple conversation turns.
- **Configurable Context Window**: Limits on number of context groups, total chunks, and prompt length are enforced to fit LLM context constraints.
- **Intelligent Grouping**: Overlapping or adjacent chunks are merged to avoid duplication and preserve order.
- **Context-Enhanced Prompts**: Prompts are structured with clear role separation (User:/Assistant:) and exclude the current message from retrieved context.
- **Performance**: Vector processing and context retrieval are asynchronous, typically adding less than 100ms to response time.
- **Comprehensive API**: 20+ endpoints for chat, search, vector operations, and system management.
- **Developer Tools**: Includes debug endpoints, statistics reporting, and a minimalist command-line chat client (PowerShell and batch scripts).

#### Chat Interface

- **Location**: `/scripts/chat/`
- **Scripts**: `chat.ps1` (PowerShell), `chat.bat` (Windows batch), and `README.md` for usage.
- **Features**: Minimalist prompt, session support, server health check, error handling, and simple exit commands.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```powershell
  .\scripts\chat\chat.ps1
  .\scripts\chat\chat.ps1 -SessionId "my-conversation"
  .\scripts\chat\chat.bat
  ```

#### Current Limitations

- **Performance**:
  - Initial message embedding adds ~500-1000ms latency.
  - Large conversation histories may increase memory usage.
  - PostgreSQL vector operations may need tuning for high-volume use.
- **Context Handling**:
  - LLM context window is limited (4096 tokens for current model).
  - Context retrieval is based on vector similarity, not deep semantic understanding.
  - Optimized for English; multi-language support is limited.
- **Operational**:
  - Requires running Ollama, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
  - Sufficient CPU/RAM needed for embedding and vector operations.
  - Dependent on Ollama API response times.
- **Data Management**:
  - No automatic cleanup of old messages or chunks.
  - Vector data accumulates over time; storage growth is unbounded.
  - Specialized backup strategies required for vector data.

#### Project Status

- **All Phases Complete**: Core infrastructure, message chaining, validation, vector search, and context-augmented generation are fully implemented and tested.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Accurate, context-aware conversations with minimal hallucination.
  - Robust error handling and chain validation.
  - Developer-friendly debugging and monitoring tools.
- **System Status**:
  - Vector similarity search and context retrieval are fully operational.
  - Assistant responses are enhanced with accurate, relevant context.

## Phase 6: Enhanced Context Management with Conversation History and Configurable Retrieval - PLANNED

Phase 6 addresses critical limitations in the current context-augmented generation system by implementing intelligent conversation history management and making the chunk retrieval system fully configurable.

### Phase 6 Problem Analysis

#### Current System Issues
1. **No Immediate Conversation History**: Current system relies entirely on vector similarity search of historical chunks, which may miss recent context
2. **Raw Chunk Retrieval**: Entire message chunks are retrieved without summarization, using excessive context window space
3. **Hardcoded Configuration**: Chunk retrieval parameters (2 before, 2 after) are hardcoded and cannot be configured
4. **Inefficient Context Usage**: No mechanism to retain key information without losing it in summarization processes

#### Current Architecture Flow
```
User Message → TimelineService → ContextRetrievalService → Vector Search → Chunk Expansion
    ↓                                                            ↓
Save Message → EnhancedOllamaService → Prompt Construction → LLM Response
```

### Phase 6 Design Overview

#### Core Components to Implement
1. **ConversationHistoryManager**: Manages rolling conversation windows and running summaries
2. **KeyInformationExtractor**: Uses LLM calls to extract key information from messages
3. **ConfigurableContextRetrievalService**: Replaces current service with configurable parameters
4. **EnhancedPromptBuilder**: Constructs prompts using both immediate history and retrieved context
5. **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration system for all retrieval parameters

#### New Architecture Flow
```
User Message → ConversationHistoryManager → KeyInformationExtractor
    ↓                              ↓
TimelineService → ConfigurableContextRetrievalService → Vector Search
    ↓                                                            ↓
EnhancedPromptBuilder → LLM Response ← Rolling History Summary
```

#### Step 3: Create Configurable Chunk Retrieval System
**Goal**: Make chunk retrieval parameters fully configurable with validation

**Components to Modify**:
- `ContextRetrievalService` → `ConfigurableContextRetrievalService`
