## Phase 5: Context-Augmented Generation with Surrounding Chunks - IN PLANNING

Phase 5 will implement truly augmented generation by retrieving similar chunks AND their surrounding context, then injecting this information as conversation history before sending the user message to the LLM.

### Phase 5 Core Concept

The goal is to enhance the assistant's responses by providing relevant conversation context without requiring the entire chat history to be sent with each request. Instead of naive conversation history (which can be expensive and hit context limits), we'll:

1. **Retrieve Similar Chunks** - Use vector similarity search to find chunks most relevant to the user's current message
2. **Expand Context** - For each retrieved chunk, get X chunks before and X chunks after from the same original message
3. **Smart Grouping** - Group related chunks together and merge overlapping groups to avoid duplicates
4. **Context Injection** - Insert these chunk groups as conversation history at the beginning of the user prompt
5. **Enhanced Responses** - Send the context-enriched prompt to the LLM for more informed responses

### Phase 5 Implementation Steps

#### 1. Enhanced Context Retrieval Service
- **New Service**: `ContextRetrievalService`
- **Functionality**:
  - Accept user message and session ID
  - Generate embedding for the user message
  - Retrieve top N similar chunks using existing `VectorStoreService.findSimilarChunks()`
  - For each retrieved chunk, get X chunks before and X chunks after from the same message
  - Return expanded context chunks grouped by their original message

#### 2. Chunk Grouping and Merging Logic
- **New Component**: `ChunkGroupManager`
- **Functionality**:
  - Group chunks by their original message ID
  - Sort chunks within each group by chunk index
  - Detect overlapping chunk groups from different messages
  - Merge overlapping groups using intelligent joining logic:
    - Compare chunk sequences for overlap detection
    - Join groups at overlapping points
    - Remove duplicate chunks while preserving chronological order
    - Handle edge cases (adjacent groups, nested overlaps)

#### 3. Context-Enhanced Prompt Construction
- **Enhanced Service**: Modify `OllamaService` or create `EnhancedOllamaService`
- **Functionality**:
  - Accept user message + context chunk groups
  - Construct enhanced prompt with format:
    ```
    Previous relevant conversation context:
    [Group 1 chunks in chronological order]
    [Group 2 chunks in chronological order]
    ...

    Current user message: [user input]
    ```
  - Ensure total prompt length stays within model context limits
  - Implement truncation strategies for very long contexts

#### 4. Integration with Chat Endpoint
- **Modify**: `TimelineService.processUserMessage()`
- **New Flow**:
  1. Save user message (existing)
  2. Process for vector storage (existing, async)
  3. **NEW**: Retrieve relevant context chunks using `ContextRetrievalService`
  4. **NEW**: Group and merge chunks using `ChunkGroupManager`
  5. **NEW**: Generate enhanced prompt with context
  6. **NEW**: Send enhanced prompt to LLM instead of raw user message
  7. Save assistant response (existing)

#### 5. Configuration and Tuning
- **Configuration Parameters**:
  - `context.chunks.before`: Number of chunks to retrieve before each similar chunk (default: 2)
  - `context.chunks.after`: Number of chunks to retrieve after each similar chunk (default: 2)
  - `context.max.groups`: Maximum number of chunk groups to include (default: 3)
  - `context.max.total.chunks`: Maximum total chunks across all groups (default: 20)
  - `context.similarity.threshold`: Minimum similarity score for chunk retrieval (default: 0.3)

#### 6. Testing and Validation
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Unique information recall (e.g., "My name is Alidibeeda" → assistant should remember name)
  - Multi-turn context preservation
  - Overlapping chunk group merging
  - Context window limit handling
  - Performance impact on response times

### Phase 5 Technical Implementation Details

#### Context Retrieval Algorithm
```java
// Pseudocode for context retrieval
List<MessageChunkEmbedding> retrieveContext(String userMessage, String sessionId) {
    // 1. Find similar chunks
    List<MessageChunkEmbedding> similarChunks = vectorStoreService.findSimilarChunks(
        userMessage, sessionId, maxSimilarChunks);

    // 2. Expand each chunk with surrounding context
    Set<ExpandedChunkGroup> expandedGroups = new HashSet<>();
    for (MessageChunkEmbedding chunk : similarChunks) {
        List<MessageChunkEmbedding> surroundingChunks = getSurroundingChunks(
            chunk.getMessageId(), chunk.getChunkIndex(), chunksBefore, chunksAfter);
        expandedGroups.add(new ExpandedChunkGroup(chunk.getMessageId(), surroundingChunks));
    }

    // 3. Merge overlapping groups
    return mergeOverlappingGroups(expandedGroups);
}
```

#### Chunk Group Merging Strategy
- **Overlap Detection**: Compare chunk sequences between groups
- **Merging Logic**: Join at overlapping points, preserving chronological order
- **Duplicate Removal**: Use chunk index and content comparison
- **Ordering**: Maintain message timestamp and chunk index ordering

#### Prompt Enhancement Strategy
- **Context Formatting**: Present chunks as natural conversation flow
- **Length Management**: Implement sliding window or priority-based truncation
- **Quality Filtering**: Prefer more recent and highly similar chunks
- **Fallback Behavior**: Graceful degradation when context is too long

### Phase 5 Expected Outcomes

#### Functional Improvements
- **Context Awareness**: Assistant remembers user-provided information across turns
- **Reduced Hallucination**: More accurate responses based on actual conversation history
- **Efficient Context Usage**: Better context utilization compared to full history approach

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Result**: Text preservation confirmed, no character loss ✅
- **Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING**

#### 🔍 **Debugging Steps**

##### **✅ Step 1: Enable Detailed Logging**
Add to `application.yml`:
```yaml
logging:
  level:
    com.agenttimeline.service.ChunkingService: DEBUG
    com.agenttimeline.service.ContextRetrievalService: DEBUG
    com.agenttimeline.service.EnhancedOllamaService: DEBUG
    com.agenttimeline.service.VectorStoreService: DEBUG
    com.agenttimeline.controller.TimelineController: DEBUG
```

##### **✅ Step 2: Use Debug Endpoints**

**Debug Context Retrieval Pipeline:**
```bash
# Inspect the complete Phase 5 pipeline for a specific session
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/timeline/debug/context/{sessionId}?userMessage=What%20did%20I%20say%20my%20name%20was%3F"
```

**Test Chunking Directly:**
```bash
# Test how text gets chunked
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/timeline/debug/chunking \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "What did I say my name was? My name is Alibideeba and I live in New York City"}'
```

**Inspect Database Chunks:**
```bash
# View all chunks for a session
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/timeline/debug/chunks/{sessionId}
```

##### **Step 3: Analyze Debug Output**

**Expected Debug Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "your-session-id",
  "userMessage": "What did I say my name was?",
  "expandedGroups": [
    {
      "messageId": "msg-uuid",
      "chunkCount": 3,
      "combinedText": "What did I say my name was? My name is Ali...",
      "chunks": [
        {
          "id": "chunk-uuid",
          "index": 0,
          "text": "What did I say my name was?",
          "textLength": 27,
          "hasEmbedding": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "mergedGroups": [...],
  "enhancedPrompt": "Previous relevant conversation context:\nContext 1:\nFrom conversation: msg-uuid\n• What did I say my name was?\n• My name is Ali...\n\nCurrent user message: What did I say my name was?",
  "configuration": {
    "chunksBefore": 2,
    "chunksAfter": 2,
    "maxSimilarChunks": 5
  }
}
```

##### **Step 4: Identify Issues**

**If you see "hat did I say my name was?":**
- ❌ **Issue**: First character 'W' is truncated
- 🔍 **Check**: Chunk storage/retrieval in database
- 🔧 **Fix**: Examine MessageChunkEmbedding entity and JSON serialization

**If you see incomplete names:**
- ❌ **Issue**: Multi-chunk content not reconstructed properly
- 🔍 **Check**: Chunking boundaries and adjacent chunk retrieval
- 🔧 **Fix**: Improve chunking algorithm to preserve word boundaries

**If single chunks work but multi-chunk fails:**
- ❌ **Issue**: Adjacent chunk retrieval logic
- 🔍 **Check**: ContextRetrievalService.getSurroundingChunks()
- 🔧 **Fix**: Verify chunk index calculation and database queries

#### 🛠️ **Immediate Fixes Required**

##### **Fix 1: Chunking Boundary Detection**
The current chunking algorithm may be breaking at suboptimal points. Update `ChunkingService.calculateChunkEnd()` to:
- Preserve complete words and names
- Avoid breaking at the beginning of important content
- Add minimum chunk size enforcement

##### **Fix 2: Context Formatting**
Review `EnhancedOllamaService.formatContextGroup()` for:
- Potential string truncation issues
- Encoding problems
- Buffer management issues

##### **Fix 3: Adjacent Chunk Retrieval**
Verify `ContextRetrievalService.getSurroundingChunks()`:
- Correct chunk index calculation
- Proper sorting of chunks
- Database query correctness

#### ✅ **Phase 5 Testing Results**

##### **Test Scenario: Name Recall**
- **Input**: "Hi, my name is Alibideeba" → "What did I say my name was?"
- **Expected**: Assistant should remember and state the name "Alibideeba"
- **Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Assistant correctly responded "your name is Alibideeba"
- **Context Used**: Successfully retrieved and included "Hi, my name is Alibideeba" in prompt

##### **Debug Endpoint Verification**
- **Context Groups Found**: 4 relevant messages retrieved
- **Enhanced Prompt Length**: 418 characters with proper formatting
- **Context Preservation**: Complete text preservation, no character truncation
