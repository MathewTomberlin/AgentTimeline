### Phase 3 Implementation Summary
- Added advanced test scenarios for message chain validation and repair:
  - Implemented methods in `TimelineService` to generate test data for:
    - Orphaned messages (messages not connected to any root)
    - Messages with broken parent references (parent does not exist)
    - Multiple root messages within a single session
  - Each scenario creates a mix of valid and invalid message chains for robust testing.
- Enhanced `TimelineService` with a new method to gather chain validation statistics across all sessions:
  - Aggregates the number of valid and invalid chains
  - Provides per-session statistics for easier debugging and monitoring
- Improved error handling and logging in chain creation and validation methods for better traceability.
- Updated documentation to reflect new test and validation capabilities.
- All changes are backward compatible and covered by new and existing tests.

### Current System Status

**Vector Similarity Search**: ✅ **WORKING** - Successfully retrieves relevant conversation chunks
**Assistant Response Enhancement**: ❌ **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED** - Retrieved context is not yet integrated into AI responses

The system successfully extracts and retrieves relevant knowledge through vector similarity search, but the assistant responses are not yet enhanced with the retrieved context. This represents the next development step for truly augmented generation capabilities.
